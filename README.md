# Archer
This is a script to install a few basic programs in Arch Linux. I have made scripts for both desktop environment(XFCE) and window manager(i3) only setups, but you can hack the script to use your preferred Desktop Environment/Window Manager. 

WM -> i3<br>
Terminal -> rxvt-unicode<br>
web browser -> Firefox, Lynx<br>
Text editor -> vim<br>
NOTE: If you want the WM only setup, run the Archer and the Archer_config scripts. If you want the DE setup, run the xArcher and the xArcher_config scripts.
